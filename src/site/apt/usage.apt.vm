Usage

  Some brief examples on how to use this plugin.

* Formatting and checking for violations as part of the build

  Probably the most common use case is to want to both format and check your
  code; add the following plugin configuration to your POM.

+----------+
<build>
  <plugins>
    ...
    <plugin>
      <groupId>com.github.gantsign.maven</groupId>
      <artifactId>ktlint-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>${project.version}</version>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <id>format-and-lint</id>
          <goals>
            <goal>format</goal>
            <goal>check</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
    ...
  </plugins>
</build>
+----------+

* Formatting

  If you just want ktlint to automatically fix what it can, add the following
  plugin configuration to your POM.

+----------+
<build>
  <plugins>
    ...
    <plugin>
      <groupId>com.github.gantsign.maven</groupId>
      <artifactId>ktlint-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>${project.version}</version>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <id>format</id>
          <goals>
            <goal>format</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
    ...
  </plugins>
</build>
+----------+

  To run this from the command line (without adding the plugin to your POM) you
  can run the following from your console:

+----------+
mvn ${project.groupId}:${project.artifactId}:${project.version}:format
+----------+

* Checking for violations as part of the build

  If you just want to drill good habits into your developers, add the following
  plugin configuration to your POM.

+----------+
<build>
  <plugins>
    ...
    <plugin>
      <groupId>com.github.gantsign.maven</groupId>
      <artifactId>ktlint-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>${project.version}</version>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <id>lint</id>
          <goals>
            <goal>lint</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
    ...
  </plugins>
</build>
+----------+

  To run this from the command line (without adding the plugin to your POM) you
  can run the following from your console:

+----------+
mvn ${project.groupId}:${project.artifactId}:${project.version}:lint
+----------+

* Generate ktlint report as part of the project reports

  To generate the ktlint report as part of the project reports, add the ktlint
  plugin in the <<<\<reporting\>>>> section of your POM.

+----------+
<reporting>
  <plugins>
    ...
    <plugin>
      <groupId>com.github.gantsign.maven</groupId>
      <artifactId>ktlint-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>${project.version}</version>
    </plugin>
    ...
  </plugins>
</reporting>
+----------+
